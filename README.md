## Known issue (help wanted!)

Adding links to Craft Entries causing issues when you double click on the entry to link to. Just click once and use the "Select" button.

Sorry for the inconvience. We're working on these annoying issues. But we decided to release a new version because of some missing important other features (like saving links the Craft way).

```terminal
composer require froala/craft-froala-wysiwyg
```
