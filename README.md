# Froala WYSIWYG editor for Craft CMS (v3)

The implementation of the Froala Editor (license not included) for Craft CMS (v3)

__[Check the Craft CMS v2 version here](https://github.com/froala/Craft-Froala-WYSIWYG/)__

![Entry Field Example](screenshots/editor-on-entry.png "Entry Field Example")

## Known issue (help wanted!)

Adding links to Craft Entries causing issues when you double click on the entry to link to. Just click once and use the "Select" button.

Sorry for the inconvience. We're working on these annoying issues. But we decided to release a new version because of some missing important other features (like saving links the Craft way).

## Installation

Tell composer to load the plugin

```terminal
composer require froala/craft-froala-wysiwyg
```

Afterwards you have to install the plugin via the control panel: 

```
Settings > Plugins > Froala WYSIWYG > Install
```

Or use the Craft CMS plugin store to install the plugin.
